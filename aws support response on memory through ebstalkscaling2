Hello,

Greetings for the day!!

Thank you for the response. I have verified your environment "Test-env" to troubleshoot the scenario. I see that the IAM role was modified correctly as required, however, on checking the environment using our internal tools, I found that the configuration files that I have specified in the step-2 of my previous correspondence were missing. I assume that these configuration files are either not created or placed in some other location instead of putting them inside the ".ebextensions" folder. At this point of time I suspect this could be the reason why the CloudWatch metrics and alarms were not created. Please do make sure that the below step (step-2 of my previous correspondence) was followed correctly and the configuration files (alarm2.config, metric.config) were placed inside the .ebextensions folder of your application. Also, make sure that you have uploaded and deployed this modified version of the application to your environment.

--------------
Create two ".config" files inside your .ebextensions folder within your deployment package one of which writes to CloudWatch and other creates CloudWatch Alarms.
(Note: Please find attached to this correspondence, the configuration files for your References. Please note that the CloudWatch alarm file creates two alarms for Memory usage above 60% and memory availability below 5%. Please modify it according to your use-case)
Here is the directory structure of my sample application for your reference:

├── .ebextensions
│   ├── alarm2.config
│   └── metric.config
├── .gitignore
├── META-INF
├── WEB-INF
└── index.jsp
----------------

Deploy it in your environment and you should be able to verify the Memory metrics inside your CloudWatch metrics under the folder "CWAgent" and similarly the CloudWatch alarms under the Alarms section of the CloudWatch. I have attached the same configuration files (alarm2.config, metric.config) to this correspondence again for your reference. Also, I have attached the sample application bundle (metric-test.zip) that I have created to test the memory metrics. Please check the folder structure by unzipping it. You can also deploy it to your environment for testing purpose (it contains sample tomcat app with the .ebextensions). Please do verify your environment and follow the above process in case you find something missing.

I hope the above information is helpful, please test it and in case the issue persists, please share the full bundle logs of your environment for further troubleshooting [1]. In case you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to get back and I will be glad to assist you further.

Wishing you a great day ahead:)
