Dear Nutan,

Greetings from Edureka!

The warning message "FailedScheduling" indicates that there is a pod that could not be scheduled onto any available node in the cluster. The reason mentioned in the warning is that the available node(s) have a taint that the pod cannot tolerate. In your case, the taint is "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule."

By default, master/control plane nodes in Kubernetes have the taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule" applied. This taint prevents regular pods from being scheduled on master/control plane nodes to avoid running user workloads on critical nodes.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

1. Deploy the pod on a worker node:
   - You can label one or more of your worker nodes with a specific label, such as "node-role=worker", using the `kubectl label` command. This will make those nodes eligible for scheduling regular pods.
   - For example, to label a node with the name "worker-1" as a worker node, run the following command:
     ```
     kubectl label node worker-1 node-role=worker
     ```
   - Once labeled, Kubernetes will consider the labeled worker node(s) for scheduling regular pods, and the pod that failed to schedule should be automatically rescheduled on the worker node.

2. Tolerate the taint on master/control plane node(s):
   - If you have specific reasons to run your pod on a master/control plane node, you can add a "toleration" to the pod's specification to allow it to tolerate the taint.
   - Add the following section under the `spec` section of your pod's YAML manifest:
     ```yaml
     tolerations:
       - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
         operator: Exists
         effect: NoSchedule
     ```
   - With this toleration, the pod will be allowed to schedule on the master/control plane node(s) despite the taint. Remember to adjust other specifications in your pod manifest as needed.

3. Modify the taint on the master/control plane node(s):
   - If you want to allow regular pods to be scheduled on the master/control plane node(s), you can remove the taint or modify it to have a different effect.
   - To remove the taint, you can run the following command:
     ```
     kubectl taint nodes <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/master-
     ```
   - Replace `<node-name>` with the name of the specific master/control plane node on which you want to remove the taint.

After implementing one of these options, the pod that previously failed to schedule should be rescheduled successfully.

Remember that running regular pods on master/control plane nodes may impact the stability and performance of your cluster, so it's generally recommended to reserve master/control plane nodes for cluster management components and critical system processes.
